This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Notable additions

* Redux
* SSR
* Flow


## CircleCI

On pushes to `master`, circleci will verify that the new code is good, run tests, do build, etc.   If all is 100% big success, it will scp the newly built code to the server.
